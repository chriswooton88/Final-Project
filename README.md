# PodPulse

## About

This website is designed to help avid podcast listeners discover new podcasts to enjoy, and link them directly to their feeds.

## Features

1. "Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app." Links were used from the array and mapped onto the website for users to interact with.
2. "Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app." Images from the array were also pulled, and appended with links to provide the user a way to listen to their chosen podcast.
3. "Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app." This website works in tandem with an iTunes API that provides the aforementioned functionality.

## Media Queries

This site is designed to function on any device, and scale to fit the needs of the user.
